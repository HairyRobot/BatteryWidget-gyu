# Battery Widget

This project is based on Battery Widget by Richard Hyndman (richard.hyndman@gmail.com).  The original open source project (http://code.google.com/p/batterywidget) became closed source from v1.7.3.


## Description
Graphical Battery Widget shows the exact battery level in 1x1 space, with shortcuts to Power-Summary/Display/Network/GPS/Wifi/BT Settings and 'Show Desktop' feature to shows your wallpaper/live-wallpaper in full screen.

**Note:**
This doesn't open, it is a Widget not an app.  Add on homescreen with 
- Menu -> Add -> Widgets -> Battery Widget or
- Apps -> Widgets -> Battery Widget

**Permissions:**
The permissions requested by the application can be quite intimidating, they are needed for quick access to various settings screens.  The application does not access/transmit device location information.
