This project is based on Battery Widget by Richard Hyndman.  The original open source project became closed source from v1.7.3.


Graphical Battery Widget shows the exact battery level in 1x1 space, with shortcuts to Power-Summary/Display/Network/GPS/Wifi/BT Settings and 'Show Desktop' feature to shows your wallpaper/live-wallpaper in full screen.

**Note:**
This doesn't open, it is a Widget not an app.  Add to homescreen with

- Menu -> Add -> Widgets -> Battery Widget or
- Apps -> Widgets -> Battery Widget or
- Long press homescreen -> Widgets -> Battery Widget


## Installation
On Android 8.0 (Oreo) or above, if upon adding Battery Widget to the homescreen, the widget show 0% or stop updating, this is likely be related to the battery optimization feature introduced in Android 8.0, to fix this, disable battery optimization for Battery Widget by

- Battery Widget: App info -> Battery optimization -> Don't optimize

then

- Remove all Battery Widget instance from homescreen.
- Re-add Battery Widget to homescreen.
